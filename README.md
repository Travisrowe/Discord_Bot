## Discord Bot - 4883-Software-Tools project

### Overview

The goal of this project is developing a bot for the group-speak application, Discord. Bots typically have all the permissions of a user on a Discord channel in that they can chat in text channels, send private messages, and even join audio channels to play snippets of audio. Bots typically have programmer-defined or even channel-admin-defined commands so that a user can type a macro, like "?help" or "!help", and receive a private message from the bot, for example.

### How to use

All commands can start with either ?, !, or $. For example, you can find a list of commands by typing one of the following.

    - ?help
    - !help
    - $help
