## Discord Bot - 4883-Software-Tools project

### Overview

The goal of this project is developing a bot for the group-speak application, Discord. Bots typically have all the permissions of a user on a Discord channel in that they can chat in text channels, send private messages, and even join audio channels to play snippets of audio. Bots typically have programmer-defined or even channel-admin-defined commands so that a user can type a macro, like "?help" or "!help", and receive a private message from the bot, for example.

Some basic capabilities of the bot should be:

- Joining capabilities
    - Join a chat channel
- Messaging capabilities
    - Programmer defined messages OR
    - User defined messages
- Audio capabilites
    - Play snippets of audio

We can start with parts 1 and 2 of the following tutorial: https://youtu.be/ZNA7Eij3UmY. This can get us to implementing Messaging capabilities.
We can then work on audio capabilities from this tutorial: https://youtu.be/MbhXIddT2YY.
And come up with ideas to make our bot unique afterward (sarcastic bot)!
